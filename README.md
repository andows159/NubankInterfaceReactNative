<p align="justify"> This application was made for the purpose of study, feel free to learn from it viewing, just as I learned when developing it. In it you learn about flexbox design, compounding, props, state management with hooks, animations and more. 
In this application I did not use a database, all the data shown in the interface are copied from the original application or provided by the user in one of the home screens</p>
